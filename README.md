# Viva_Preparation_Tool

This code implements a "VIVA preparation tool" using several Python libraries and APIs. Let's break down the technical aspects of each component:

1.  Importing Libraries :
   - The code imports necessary libraries such as Gradio (for building interactive UI), ChromaDB (for document storage and retrieval), PyPDF2 (for PDF processing), dotenv (for environment variable management), and Groq (for interacting with the Groq API).

2.  Setting up Groq and ChromaDB Clients :
   - It initializes a Groq client using an API key retrieved from user data. This client is used to interact with the Groq API, specifically for querying the Llama3 model.
   - It initializes a ChromaDB client, which is used to create a collection for storing processed PDF documents.

3.  PDF Processing and Storage :
   - The process_pdf function reads a PDF file and extracts text from each page using PyPDF2.
   - It splits the text into chunks using a special character as a delimiter and assigns unique IDs to each chunk.
   - Then, it creates a collection in ChromaDB and adds the text chunks with their corresponding IDs to the collection.

4.  Querying Replicate Model :
   - The query_replicate function is responsible for querying the Replicate model (Llama3) based on user input.
   - It processes the uploaded PDF file using process_pdf and stores it in ChromaDB.
   - It retrieves relevant text chunks from the processed PDF based on the user's query.
   - It constructs a context message combining the query and the retrieved text chunks.
   - It sends the context message to the Llama3 model via the Groq API to generate a response.
   - Finally, it returns the response generated by the Llama3 model.

5.  Gradio Interface :
   - Using Gradio, the code creates an interactive interface with components for uploading a PDF file, entering a query/question, and displaying the response.
   - When the user clicks the "Submit" button, it triggers the query_replicate function with the uploaded PDF file and user query as inputs.
   - The response generated by the Llama3 model is displayed in the UI.

6.  Launching the Interface :
   - The demo.launch() statement launches the Gradio interface, allowing users to interact with the VIVA preparation tool.

Overall, this code integrates PDF processing, document storage, machine learning model querying, and UI components to create a user-friendly tool for preparing for VIVA examinations. Users can upload PDF documents, ask questions, and receive relevant responses generated by the Llama3 model.
